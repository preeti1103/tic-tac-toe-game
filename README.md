## Features

- **Two game modes**: Player vs Player or Player vs Computer
- **Smart AI**: Computer makes strategic moves (not just random!)
- **Clean UI**: Colorful design with smooth animations
- **Win detection**: Automatically highlights winning moves
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works on phones and tablets

## How It Works

This game uses:
- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for all the game logic
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting

The computer AI:
1. First checks if it can win immediately
2. Then blocks the player if they're about to win
3. Finally makes a strategic move if neither applies
